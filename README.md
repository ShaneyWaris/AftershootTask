# Aftershoot Task

### About the Task

-   Need to create a react app who is able to handle thousands of images upload and show it on the Grid.

### What I have done?

-   I have used the Recyclerview implementation approach to acheive this. 
-   Images will only be rendered only when they appear on the viewport.
-   References I have used: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API


### How to run it locally?

-   Clone the repo
-   cd to the folder
-   open terminal in that folder
-   run "npm install"
-   run "npm start"
